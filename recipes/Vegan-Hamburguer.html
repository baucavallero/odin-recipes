    <p>Say hello to the <strong>BEST veggie burger</strong> recipe! Of course, that’s just my opinion, but once you try it, I think you’ll agree. For one, these patties are grill-able! And if you’d rather be spending time in the sun than in the kitchen, you can even make them a day or two in advance.</p>

    <p>But that’s not all. This veggie burger <strong>has an amazing meaty texture and savory, smoky flavor</strong>. It’ll keep its shape when it’s stuffed inside a bun, and it’s delicious with fancy fixings or with good old ketchup and mustard. Unlike many packaged veggie burgers, its incredible texture and flavor come from simple, plant-based ingredients, <strong>so it doesn’t just taste good – it’s good for you, too!</strong></p>

    <p>So many readers have made and loved this veggie burger recipe over the last few years. If it’s not already obvious, we’re also pretty obsessed with it. Jack and I are making it this weekend to celebrate the unofficial start of summer, and I hope you will too. Hearty, flavorful, and really darn fun, it’s not a recipe you want to miss!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 shallots, chopped (⅔ cup)</li>
        <li>2 shallots, chopped (⅔ cup)</li>
        <li>16 ounces mushrooms, mix of shiitake + portobello, stemmed and diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tamari</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin, or ½ teaspoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sriracha, more if desired</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>¼ cup ground flaxseed</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked short-grain brown rice, freshly cooked so that it’s sticky*</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>Vegan Worcestershire sauce, for brushing</li>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray, for grilling</li>
        <li>Hamburger buns & desired burger fixings</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté until soft, 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and a generous pinch of salt, and sauté until soft and browned, 6 to 9 minutes, turning down the heat slightly, as needed.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tamari, vinegar, and mirin. Stir, reduce the heat, then add the garlic, smoked paprika, and sriracha. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the sautéed mushrooms, walnuts, flaxseed, brown rice, and ½ cup of the panko. Pulse until just combined. The mixture should hold together when pinched, but it should still have some texture.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the remaining panko.</li>
        <li>Form into 8 patties, place them on a large plate and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>If you're grilling the patties, preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Brush the patties with olive oil and spray the grill with cooking spray. Place the patties on the grill and use a spatula to press down lightly. Grill for 7 minutes on the first side, flip, and grill for 6 to 7 minutes on the second side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Alternately, cook the patties on the stove. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Coat the bottom of the skillet with oil and cook the patties for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, brush with Worcestershire sauce, and serve with desired fixings.</li>
    </ol>
