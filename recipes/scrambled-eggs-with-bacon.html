        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Once melted add in eggs.</li>
        <li>Once the egg mixture seems to have set, break it up with a spatula to scramble and flip. Continue cooking and scrambling until eggs are fully cooked and no longer runny. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
